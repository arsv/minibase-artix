Build scripts for Artix+minibase qemu images.
Run `make` to build and `./xqemu.sh` to boot.

Build requirements: make, curl, bsdtar, fakeroot, perl,
    mkfontdir, mkfs.ext4, mkfs.fat, cpio, syslinux, modprobe.

Pre-built xorg-server and minibase packages are in ./local
PKGBUILDs for them are in ./build but re-building them is
left out of Makefile because it requires makepkg and a host
system running either Artix or mainline Arch Linux.

The list of packages to include is at the top of ./rootfs.px

Beware the complete image is over 1GB!


Once the system is running:

    Ctrl-F2: root console
    Ctrl-F3: 1st X session (also default)
    Ctrl-F5: 2nd X session
    Ctrl-Esc: control VT, commands there:

        Shift-P: poweroff
	Shift-R: reboot
	Esc: go back

To use pacman, make sure to initialize its db for the root console:

    pacman-db-upgrade 

There's also a serial console on the 1st serial port in qemu.
Hit Ctrl-Alt-2 (or 3) to switch there. Go back with Ctrl-Alt-1.
