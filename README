Build scripts for Artix+minibase qemu images.
Run `make` to build and `./xqemu.sh` to boot.

Pre-built xorg-server and minibase packages are in ./local
PKGBUILDs for them are in ./build but re-building them is
left out of Makefile because it requires makepkg and a host
system running either Artix or mainline Arch Linux.

The list of packages to include is at the top of ./rootfs.px

Beware the complete image is over 1GB!
